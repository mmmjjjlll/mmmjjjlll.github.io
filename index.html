My research and teaching interests are in interactive digital media, visual perception of art, pattern recognition, and self-organization. Before joining Ritsumeikan, I was a Senior Research Scientist at the Advanced Telecommunications Research Labs located in southern Kyoto prefecture. Before moving to Japan, I was a member of the faculty at the University of Southern California and the research faculty at Caltech. I studied Physics at McGill and the University of British Columbia.
